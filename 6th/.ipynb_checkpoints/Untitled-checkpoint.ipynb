      " |  The flask object implements a WSGI application and acts as the central\n",
      " |  object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the\n",
      " |  application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for\n",
      " |  the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the\n",
      " |  package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the\n",
      " |  package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with\n",
      " |  an :file:`__init__.py` file inside) or a standard module (just a ``.py`` file).\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  For more information about resource loading, see :func:`open_resource`.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or\n",
      " |  in the :file:`__init__.py` file of your package like this::\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      from flask import Flask\n",
      " |      app = Flask(__name__)\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  .. admonition:: About the First Parameter\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      The idea of the first parameter is to give Flask an idea of what\n",
      " |      belongs to your application.  This name is used to find resources\n",
      " |      on the filesystem, can be used by extensions to improve debugging\n",
      " |      information and a lot more.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single\n",
      " |      module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are\n",
      " |      using a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of\n",
      " |      your package there.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      For example if your application is defined in :file:`yourapplication/app.py`\n",
      " |      you should create it with one of the two versions below::\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |          app = Flask('yourapplication')\n",
      " |          app = Flask(__name__.split('.')[0])\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      Why is that?  The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks\n",
      " |      to how resources are looked up.  However it will make debugging more\n",
      " |      painful.  Certain extensions can make assumptions based on the\n",
      " |      import name of your application.  For example the Flask-SQLAlchemy\n",
      " |      extension will look for the code in your application that triggered\n",
      " |      an SQL query in debug mode.  If the import name is not properly set\n",
      " |      up, that debugging information is lost.  (For example it would only\n",
